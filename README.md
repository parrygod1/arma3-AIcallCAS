An unfinished concept that makes the AI call in CAS from player pilots via tasking. Works automatically on any editor placed or spawned AI infantry group.

Features
  - Task handling
  - Task description with a 9-Line containing target description, location, desired payload
  - Custom logic to determine whether CAS is required. This is done by calculating a squads total force and survival chance against known targets
  - Waypoints for IP, target and egress visible only when task is selected
